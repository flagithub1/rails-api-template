FULL STACK PROJECT:STAR LookApp
Star lookApp, as the name  suggests, it’s an app that let you interact, kinda ,with  the players of your your favorite team  after you signed up and become a member ,it’s a paid service app, because ,we’re dealing with public figures and privacy is a big deal ,so for this reason  we ‘re charging  a li’l fee of a thousand dollars, and if you happen to be a season ticket holder, you get it  for free, just sign up, this app is highly secured to prevent any type of fraudulent activity, and violators will be prosecuted. This app is still in the building phase, you might get a bad request or not found if anybody without proper credentials try to access it.

List of technologies used so far:
Html, Css, JavaScript,  Jquery ,  Ajax, API, RAILS
That's the first phase of the project, eventually it will have the missing features,which i'm still working on ,stuff like adding the the players section,handlebars ,styling.
All that stuff require planning,which is always overlooked,but it's kinda like a map if you will,i don't know if it's because the list look intimidating,i still struggle with planning,but as many will testify,planning is a friend you want to have, but i'am a li'l bit better at it,and hopefully one day we can become best friends.

If you click on either link  below you'll see where it all started,ofcourse it looks a li'l different now, but the main idea is still there.
